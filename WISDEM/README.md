# IEA Wind 22-MW RWT: WISDEM Model

Provided WISDEM scripts:

 * `run_model.py` : WISDEM analysis (no design optimization) of the IEA Wind 22-MW RWT.  Uses the WindIO ontology file directly as input, along with `modeling_options.yaml` and `analysis_options.yaml`. Script also includes automated plotting of blade geometry, rotor performance, and tower geometry.  The tabular data Excel sheet is also generated.
  
For more information about WISDEM and how these scripts can be run, please see the WISDEM [documentation](https://wisdem.readthedocs.io) and [repository](https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM).

# IEA-22-280-RWT
This repository contains the model data for the 22-MW offshore reference turbine developed within IEA Wind Task 55 [REFWIND](https://iea-wind.org/task-55/).

The documentation for the turbine is in progress.

Data in this repository includes:
* Documentation, including tabular data used in the figures from the technical report
* [OpenFAST](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast.git) aeroelastic model inputs
* [HAWC2](https://www.hawc2.dk/) aeroelastic model inputs
* [WISDEM](https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM) optimization files
* [WindIO](https://windio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) turbine ontology .yaml files
* CAD modeling of turbine where available

## Requirements

*OpenFAST*:
* Please check the release notes for OpenFAST version compatibility.  OpenFAST can be compiled [from source here](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast.git) or precompiled Windows binaries are [available for download](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/releases/latest/download/windows_openfast_binaries.zip). More information on installing and running OpenFAST is available in [OpenFAST documention](https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
* NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) is required.  This can be compiled [from source here](https://github.com/nrel/rosco) or precompiled binaries for all platforms are [available for download](https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO/releases/).  The version of the ROSCO controller can be found in the header of the [DISCON.IN](https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/IEA-22-280-RWT/blob/e76514e59c8a152c35a46248559e3787693a5ff5/OpenFAST/IEA-22-280-RWT-Monopile/IEA-22-280-RWT_DISCON.IN#L2)

*HAWC2*:
* HAWC2 can be acquired from its [homepage](https://www.hawc2.dk/).  The DTU Basic Controller can be obtained from its [repository](https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/OpenLAC/BasicDTUController).

*WISDEM*:
 * WISDEM can be installed from its Github [repository](https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM).
 * See the [documentation](https://wisdem.readthedocs.io) for installation and usage guides.


## Large files are tracked using Git LFS 

The repository contains a variety of large files, for example the cross-sectional meshes used to generate the stiffness and inertia matrices in the WindIO file.
These files are tracked using Git LFS, so to retrieve these files when cloning the repository you need to install Git LFS on your local machine, see https://git-lfs.com/. 


## Community Contributions

The authors of the IEA 22 hope that the turbine is used widely. Notable studies adopting the turbine will be listed here, together with models of the turbine implemented in other codes:

* A DNVGL Bladed model was developed by [DNV](mailto:renewables.support@dnv.com) and is available upon reasonable request.
* A [QBlade](https://qblade.org) model was developed by researchers at [TU Berlin](https://qblade.org/contact/) and is available upon reasonable request.

## Acknowledgments

The IEA 22 offshore reference wind turbine was made possible thanks to countless inputs from a long list of collaborators. A non exhaustive list includes Mayank Chetan and Emmanuel Branlard at NREL, William Collier and Dilek Ors at DNVGL, David Marten at TU Berlin, and Georg Pirrung and Katherine Dykes at DTU.
DTU's participation in IEA Wind Task 37 and Task 55 is sponsored by the Danish Energy Agency under contract no. EUDP-64019-0588 and EUDP-134234-512032.
We also wish to acknowledge Equinor for sponsoring a co-financed research project, which formed the basis for the IEA 22 MW RWT rotor design.
